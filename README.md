# Get next line
This project is about programming a function that returns a line
read from a file descriptor.

It will also make you learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming: static variables.

## Function prototype:

``` python
char	*get_next_line(int fd);
```

## Arguments
Gets a integer number that refers to the file descriptor to read from.

Having a correct behavior, returns, read line, one line at a time. otherwise retunrs NULL if ther is nothing else to read, or an error occurred.

Only read, malloc, and free functions are allowed.


We consider that get_next_line() has an undefined behavior if the file pointed to by the file descriptor changed since the last call whereas read() didnâ€™t reach the end of file.

We also consider that get_next_line() has an undefined behavior when reading
a binary file. However, you can implement a logical way to handle this behavior if you want to.

## Bonus
A) Develop get_next_line() using only one static variable.

B) Your get_next_line() can manage multiple file descriptors at the same time.  For example, if you can read from the file descriptors 3, 4 and 5, you should be able to read from a different fd per call without losing the reading thread of each file descriptor or returning a line from another fd.  It means that you should be able to call get_next_line() to read from fd 3, then fd 4, then 5, then once again 3, once again 4, and so forth.

## Compilation

Because you will have to read files in get_next_line(), add this option to your compiler call: -D BUFFER_SIZE=n

It will define the buffer size for read().  The buffer size value will be modified by your peer-evaluators and the Moulinette in order to test your code.

**We must be able to compile this project WITH and WITHOUT** the -D BUFFER_SIZE flag in addition to the usual flags. You can choose the default value of your choice. I defined the BUFFER_SIZE in get_next_line.h file just in case the compiler does note defient it for me.

```Makefile
# ifndef BUFFER_SIZE
# define BUFFER_SIZE 43
# endif /* BUFFER_SIZE */
```

You will compile your code as follows (a buffer size of 42 is used as an example): cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 get_next_line.c

To have more flexibility defining buffer size at compilation time i figured out how to invoke `make` with an argument:

```bash
make SIZE=100
```

Then inside `Makefile` my `CFLAGS` definition becomes:

```Makefile
ifeq ($(SIZE),)
	CFLAGS = -Wall -Wextra  -Werror
else
 	CFLAGS = -Wall -Wextra  -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=$(SIZE)
endif
```

With a file `size.txt` and an additional variable `PREVIOUS_SIZE` I check if buffer size has changed, so i need to recompile.

```Makefile

PREVIOUS_SIZE=$(shell cat size.txt)

all: $(NAME) 
ifeq ($(SIZE),$(PREVIOUS_SIZE))
	@echo "No size change"
else
	@echo "size change"
	@echo $(SIZE) > size.txt
	@make re
endif
```
